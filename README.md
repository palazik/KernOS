## What is KernOS?

KernOS is a minimal, performance-focused Linux distribution based on CachyOS & Arch Linux. It strips away everything unnecessary and ships only what you actually need — giving you a fast, responsive system from the first boot.

Built by a kernel developer, for people who care about what runs under the hood.

---

## Philosophy

- **No bloat** — if it's not needed, it's not included
- **Performance first** — optimized defaults out of the box
- **Transparent** — you know exactly what's running on your system
- **Arch foundation** — rolling release, access to the full AUR, pacman

---

## Features

- Minimal package selection — nothing preinstalled you didn't ask for
- Optimized kernel configuration
- Fast boot times
- Clean archiso-based build system
- Fully reproducible ISO builds via GitHub Actions

---

## Building the ISO

### Requirements

```bash
sudo pacman -S archiso
```

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KernOS/core.git
cd core
sudo mkarchiso -v -w /tmp/kernos-work -o out/ profile/
```

The ISO will be output to `out/`.

### Test in QEMU

```bash
run_archiso -i out/kernos-*.iso
```
